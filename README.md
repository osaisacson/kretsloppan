# Kretsloppan

iOS/Android app supporting local sustainable reuse of building materials.
In collaboration with Egnahemsfabriken - (https://coompanion.se/2020/11/10/egnahemsfabriken-blir-arets-kooperativ-2020/ "Swedish Cooperative of the Year 2020"). The project was developed with the support of Vinnova - Swedens innovation agency.

Kretsloppan serves as a tool for the residents of Tjörns Kommun to manage local logistics of bartering, buying and selling of used building materials. The heart of this work is the center for reused materials located at Egnahemsfabriken.

The app allows the user to:

- Upload their own materials
- Browse available materials
- Book and confirm pick up of materials
- Freely advertise for needed materials
- Create projects
- Associate collected materials to projects, providing follow up to where the materials end up in their second (third, fourth...) lives.

Kretsloppan is a local, non-profit initiative which welcomes collaborations. We work according to decentralised principles and believe in tech adjusting to local conditions, not the other way around. If you wish to setup similar initiatives in your vicinity feel welcome to contact us through asaisacson@gmail.com for support.

- SDK Platforms > install the top first three in the list.
- SDK Tools > install Android build tools, emulator, sdk platform tools and sdk tools, google play services and intel emulator
- Configure > AVD manager > create virtual device > select a phone that has play store icon > choose and download OS > once created click the green play button under actions to launch the device
- Go to your terminal. If you’re not already running write `expo start` then with that process running `a` to launch the Expo project on android. It’ll first need to install some stuff so patience, young one.

### Run on iPhone simulator

## FAQ

### How do I debug?

Android: in the simulator press cmd + m
iOS: in the simulator press cmd + d
Make sure in your original browser window (the one that opened when you ran npm start) you’ve set lan or local, not tunnel. Otherwise it will be super slow.

### How do I reload simulators?

Android: RR
iOS: CMD + R

### How do I use this repo as a template for a new project?

- Clone the project
- Create a new firebase db: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Change the name of example-env in the root of your project to env.js and (IMPORTANT) include it in your gitignore file.
- In firebase, go to project settings and find your project details. Update the account details in env.js
- Delete all specific firebase files in root, these will be generated in the next step
- `firebase init` - select installing all options. Follow all defaults apart for functions, do not overwrite these.
- In firebase project settings download the google-services.json file from your apps/android and the GoogleService-Info.plist from your apps/iOS, add these to the root of your project
- In firebase/auth set up your authentication
